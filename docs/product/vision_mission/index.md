At AYA, our mission is to provide innovative and accessible technological solutions that support disaster response efforts and empower communities in times of crisis.

Our core values include collaboration, empathy, and innovation, and we strive to embody these values in all aspects of our work. We are dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive community of volunteers, partners, and stakeholders who share our commitment to leveraging technology for the greater good.
