title: About AYA

---

We are a group of over 23,000 volunteers around the world, most of whom are IT professionals and specialists in various areas. We came together in response to disasters and humanitarian crises, with the aim of using our skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world. Our team is made up of individuals who are passionate about making a difference, and we work together to develop innovative solutions that can help those in need.

At AYA, we believe in the power of open-source technology and the value of collaboration. We are proud to have established a strong community on [GitHub](https://github.com/acikkaynak/), where our members can share their expertise, collaborate on projects, and contribute to our mission of helping others. We also use Discord to communicate and organize our efforts, as it allows us to work together in real-time and stay connected even when we're in different parts of the world.
